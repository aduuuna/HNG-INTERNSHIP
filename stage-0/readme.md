# HNG Internship Backend Track (Stage 0)

This directory **`stage-0`** contains my submission for the **Stage 0 Backend task** of the HNG Internship.  
The goal of this task is to build a **simple RESTful API endpoint** that returns my profile information along with a **dynamic cat fact**, fetched from an external API.

This validates my ability to:

- Consume a third-party API.
- Format JSON responses.
- Return dynamic data in an Express.js application.
